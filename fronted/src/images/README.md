## Model Marketplace

1. DeOldify Photos

   A Deep Learning based project for colorizing and restoring old images!

2. FB Prophet Forecast

   This service uses Prophet and Statsmodel to forecast and analyze points of a given time series.

3. Text Generation

   The service receives a textual seed in English and uses it as input to the neural GPT-2 model trained to solve diverse text generation task using large-scale Reddit-dump based dataset and outputs the generated text for a given seed. The model runs on a P100 GPU. The basic commonsense model generates diverse text adapting to the style and content of the given text seed. The number of models will be expanded to allow the generation of texts related to specific subject areas and simulate the discourse of public persons.

4. Detect Faces

   One of four Face Services (localization, landmark detection, alignment, and recognition,) face-detect identifies computer generated bounding boxes to detect faces within an image.

5. Image Segmentation

   Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

   Use this service to associate each pixel of a provided image with a class label such as identifying cars, bicycles and people. Useful for applications such as autonomous driving, manufacturing robotics, medical imaging and video surveillance.

   Simply upload an image you want to analyse and hit Invoke, the image will then be processed and the results displayed.
